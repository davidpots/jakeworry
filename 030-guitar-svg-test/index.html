<h1>Fretboard ASCII to SVG</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago I mocked this up, having been spinning on this idea for a while now:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/7517/screenshots/1379011/20140115-songnotes-mobile-chord.png" /></p>
<p>...and tonight I dove into making the magic work in the browser. Just the first step, at least. Proving the concept.</p>
<h3>First, some fretboard text...</h3>
<p>This could be any chord you imagine on guitar, provided you follow the 6-string constraints when typing it out. All lowercase o's will translate to finger "dots" in the SVG below. This basic approach will work for mapping out scale diagrams, once I save those SVGs too.</p>

        <!-- Fretboard -->
        <h3>Resulting SVG Fretboard</h3>
        <p>After some crude JS magic, the text above is converted to this SVG goodness. Resize your browser and rejoice at how eternally crisp it is.</p>
        <div id="container">
          <div id="dummy"></div>
          <div id="fretboard"></div>
        </div>

<p>More coming soon! This is just the beginning. <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1379011-Mobile-Guitar-Chords-First-Concept?list=users">Here are some more thoughts</a> on where I may want to go with this.</p>

<h3>Quick Note on the Freboard Size</h3>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time with this figuring out how to display the fretboard so its size could scale. For a quick demo, simply resize your browser -- you'll see the fretboard (and its content) all shrink while maintaining scale. Likewise, they could expand/grow and stay in scale too.</p>
<p>The most helpful resource I found on doing this was <a href="http://ansciath.tumblr.com/post/7347495869/css-aspect-ratio">via this article</a>. Check out the source HTML and CSS to see how I did it. A few extra div's are required, but it definitely seems worth it to me given the cool ways I could use this to display fretboards in different sizes and contexts.</p>
