This time, I'm following this tutorial:

http://th3silverlining.com/2012/04/22/using-the-heroku-shared-database-with-sinatra-and-active-record/

But realizing it is partially incomplete / not detailed enough, I am augmenting it with bits of instruction from this tutorial (which I'd gone through prior):

http://mherman.org/blog/2013/06/08/designing-with-class-sinatra-plus-postgresql-plus-heroku/#.VFfwLlPF-Do

By following them both together, I'm hoping to better triangulate and understand the core fundamentals of this process.
