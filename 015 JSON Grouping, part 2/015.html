    <h1>015: JSON Grouping, part 2</h1>
    <p>In which we take an array of song objects, group them by year, and display the year-groups from newest to oldest. Re-covering some core fundamentals of handling objects, arrays, and the like. Next project, I'll want to clean up + make more efficient this code, as well as eventually let users group by anything (not just 'year').</p>
