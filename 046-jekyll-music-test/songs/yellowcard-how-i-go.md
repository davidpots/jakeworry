## Chord progression cheat sheet

For quick references to the _general_ tonal progressions used in this song, refer to this. For instructions & notes on exactly how to approach and play the chords on guitar, see further down this page. There are plenty of chord idiosyncrasies involving modified bass notes, atypical open strings, etc that I'm not worried about covering here.

## Lyrics with general chords

Here are the lyrics, with the generalized chords to match. For chord positions, tabs, etc -- see the notes further down the page (there are various ways to approach the chord positions in this song).

    INTRO
        E (for exact chords, see tabs below)

    VERSE
                E            F#m
        I could tell you the wildest of tales
        B                        E
        My friend the giant, and traveling sales
        E                F#m
        Tell you all the times that I failed
            B                        E
        The years all behind me, the stories exhaled.

    CHORUS
                C#m           E             B
            And I'm... drying out... crying out...
                 A           E (walk down)
            This isn't how I go

        I could tell you of a man not so tall
        Who said life's a circus, and so we are small
        Tell you of a girl that I saw
        I froze in the moment, and she changed it all

            And I'm... drying out... crying out...
            This isn't how I go
            ...Hurry now... lay me down...
                                 B      C#m     A     E
            And let these waters flow...
                                 B      C#m     A     E
                              ...flow...

    BRIDGE
                C#m           B              A                    E 
                Son, I am not everything you thought that I would be
                    F#m           G#m          A           B
                But every story I have told is part of me-----
                  
                                               (intro chords x4, then walk down)

        And you keep the air in my lungs
        Floating along as a melody comes
        And my heart beats like timpani drums
        Keeping the time while a symphony strums

            And I'm... drying out... crying out...
            This isn't how I go
            ...Hurry now... lay me down...
            And let these waters flow...
                              ...flow...
                       ...let it flow...
                       ...let it flow...

                Son I am not everything you thought that I would be
                But every story I have told is part of me
                Son I leave you now but you have so much more to do
                And every story I have told is part of you

## How to play the intro chords

The four chords that make up the repeating part of the verse can be played a few ways. The band plays it something like this, which is a bit tricker if you're new to guitar.

    e-|----0---------0----------0---------0------
    B-|----0---------0----------0---------0------
    G-|----9---------9----------8---------9------
    D-|----x---------6----------9---------7------
    A-|----9---------7----------7---------0------
    E-|----0---------0---------------------------
           E*        E          B         A

Or, here's a slightly easier way I sometimes play it using more open positioning. This sounds _mostly_ like the version above -- definitely enough so to sell it. So many of the tonalities here are blended together (which is nice!) that it allows you to get away with a bit more than usual.

    e-|----0---------0----------0---------0------
    B-|----0---------0----------0---------0------
    G-|----2---------1----------8---------6------  ]     For the B and A chords,
    D-|----4---------2----------9---------7------  ] <-- keep E-shape on these
    A-|----0---------2----------9---------7------  ]     three strings.
    E-|----0---------0---------------------------
           E*        E          B         A          

## How to play the walk down riff

There are many ways to do this! Check out the choices below and use the one that works for you. Each of these is using the same notes; it's only your approach to playing the chord shapes that varies.

### How Yellowcard probably plays it

This is probably how the band plays it -- you have minimal movement down the fretboard, but you're required to have a strong and stretched out pinky. This is a good one to eventually practice if you're learning all of these. This is similar to how Dave Matthews plays the verse in #41, by the way.

    E-|-------0--0--------0--0--------0--0-------0--0---
    A-|-------0--0--------0--0--------0--0-------0--0---
    D-|-------9--9--------9--9--------9--9-------9--9--- <-- Pinky stays here.
    G-|----9-----------7-----------6---------(7)-------- <-- Index finger here.
    B-|---------------------------------------9--------- <-- Ring finger here.
    E-|-------------------------------------------------

### Single finger walk-down (easy)

This approach is easy as pie, and a great exercise in muting: just put your ring finger on the 4th string. Mute the 3rd string with that same ring finger (by draping the finger over the 3rd string so it touches, but doesn't press down). Let the top two strings ring openly. There you have it!

    e-|-------0-0------0-0------0-0------0-0---
    B-|-------0-0------0-0------0-0------0-0---
    G-|-------x-x------x-x------x-x------x-x---  <-- Mute with your ring finger.
    D-|----9--------7--------6--------4--------  <-- Ring finger plays these.
    A-|----------------------------------------
    E-|----------------------------------------

### Open-position version

The idea behind this approach is you're down in the open position of the E-major chord -- and thus, are playing the bass notes as heard in the chord. For the 2nd step of the walkdown, add your pinky finger on the third string (which is how you'd also play an Esus4). For the 4th step of the walkdown, you're sliding your index and ring fingers up to the 2nd and 4th frets, respctively -- and note, these are the strings they're already on if you're in the E-major position!

    e-|---0---|------0-0------0-0-----0-0------0-0---
    B-|---0---|---0--0-0------0-0-----0-0------0-0---
    G-|---1---|------------2-------1-------(2)-------
    D-|---2---|-----------------------------4--------
    A-|---2---|--------------------------------------
    E-|---0---|--------------------------------------
