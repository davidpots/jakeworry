A cleverly named repo for me to keep track of random jQuery tidbits + explorations, so I can access them later in future coding endeavors. I try to break down each fundamental lesson into a single entry. Most recent exercises are at the top!

#### 007 Animation 101

Quick review of core fundies of jQuery animation + random number generation + JS looping. Simple goal with this exercise is to give a variable width to each line of faux text in a graphical version of a document.

#### 006 Mustache 101

Quick review of the core fundamentals of Mustache. Based on this, and then simplified even further: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-using-the-mustache-template-library/

#### 005 Artsy Columns, part 4

This is the culmination of the previous few projects. I take the Artsy-style layout, with all the intriciacy, and make the fixed-column-interaction work for all `<article>` items on the page, however many there may be.

#### 004 Artsy Columns, part 3

Here, I solve the issue of "scaling up" the mechanism to work with all 'article' items on the page. Note, that this is based off '002' and doesn't yet include all effects required for my desired implementation. That will be next.

#### 003 Artsy Columns, part 2

Before scaling up my mechanism to work on all 'article' items on the page, I instead delve into the effect/interaction on the single 'article'. Now it fixes itself on the top, or bottom -- depending on your page position and scroll direction.

#### 002 Artsy Columns

Getting nitty gritty with recreating the fixed column effect used at http://artsy.net/posts/featured. In 002, I get the mechanism to work on a single 'article' amongst a page of many articles. From here, I will (in future lessons) scale it up to work on all 'articles' on the page.

#### 001 inView

Quick exploration of the inView plugin, used to determine when an element is in the user's window view
