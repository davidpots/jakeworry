A cleverly named repo for me to keep track of random jQuery tidbits + explorations, so I can access them later.

### 001 inView

Quick exploration of the inView plugin, used to determine when an element is in the user's window view

### 002 Artsy Columns

Getting nitty gritty with recreating the fixed column effect used at http://artsy.net/posts/featured. In 002, I get the mechanism to work on a single 'article' amongst a page of many articles. From here, I will (in future lessons) scale it up to work on all 'articles' on the page.

### 003 Artsy Columns, part 2

Before scaling up my mechanism to work on all 'article' items on the page, I instead delve into the effect/interaction on the single 'article'. Now it fixes itself on the top, or bottom -- depending on your page position and scroll direction.

### 004 Artsy Columns, part 3

Here, I solve the issue of "scaling up" the mechanism to work with all 'article' items on the page. Note, that this is based off '002' and doesn't yet include all effects required for my desired implementation. That will be next.
